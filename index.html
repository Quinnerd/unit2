<p1>one you know works at a store that sells iPods. He steals some and asks if you want to buy one for less than half the price the store sells it for? Should you buy it? Why or why not?
<p2>
I probably would buy one, maybe if it wasn't an Ipod, maybe if it was like a new phone that isn't from 2008. Because if the police were to ask me where I got, it I would just say I didn't know it was stolen.
