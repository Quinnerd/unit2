    <h2> Causes of World Hunger </h2>
    <p> A lot of people may think that food shortage is the main cause of world hunger, which is a part of it, but not the main reason. It is actually the widespread poverty of third world countries, this is because drouts and weather disasters can destroy peoples homes leaving them with nothing. </p>
