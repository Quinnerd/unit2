<h1> How To Help </h1>
<p> You can help by donating to your local food shelter, such as Valley Churches </p>
<br>
<p>Valley Churches United Missions (VCUM) is a grassroots organization serving the needs of low-income residents in the San Lorenzo Valley and Scotts Valley. We are a nonprofit (501c3) that does not receive government funding or grants â€” we rely entirely on the generous donations of individuals and local businesses and organizations.</p>
